# New interactions and options when booking on hourly schedule board

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Select a specific status, including "proposed" statuses, when booking from the hourly board.

The default status from the booking setup metadata (BSM) record will be the default "committed" status for that "booking type."

The status list will be filtered based on BSM. For more about custom statuses, check out this [previous blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/06/01/manage-the-status-of-your-teams-bookings-with-universal-resource-scheduling/).

New interactions and options when booking on hourly schedule board will help precisely show where you are hovering so when you click a time, you know what will be loaded into the booking panel.
