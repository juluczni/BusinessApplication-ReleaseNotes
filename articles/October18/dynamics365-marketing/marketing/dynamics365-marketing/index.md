[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Since its launch in Spring release, Dynamics 365 for Marketing continues to see
good traction with businesses to support their digital transformation. The
capabilities in the October ’18 release extend the reach and improve the funnel
velocity with deeper intelligence. New features range from Account Based
Marketing, custom reporting based on Power BI, to enabling predictive lead
scoring. We also expand our [reach](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck) to 108 markets with 15 additional languages.

The key themes for this release empower even broader digital transformation
across business apps:

**Intelligence** – integrated into the app experience - marketers can now build
custom dashboards using Power BI leveraging data from various apps, marketing
interactions, and other data sources. The brand new add-on Marketing Insights
app provides predictive capabilities that seamlessly blend into the core
marketing, while Social Listening enriches brand awareness during campaign
execution right on the customer journey canvas.

**Personalized Marketing** – experiences are fine tuned for users as well as
prospects. Account Based Marketing helps close more deals by targeting specific
accounts that are most likely to generate revenue. Content management is now
supported at block level with role-based editing privileges. Marketers can see a
calendar of all journeys and events to plan better.

**One Microsoft Integrations** – marketing app further leverages the power of
Microsoft Cloud with a wide spectrum of products, data & technologies. This
release adds video marketing via Streams, deeper LinkedIn integration extending
from content to marketing automation, and the Power platform drives all the
fabric leading to custom reporting for the marketing app.

**Fundamentals** – Improvements to optimize the embedded insights engine for
performance, and greater scalability and throughput of email marketing services.
The user interface is further improved in both usability and performance for
most used scenarios.
